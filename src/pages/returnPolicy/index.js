If you are not entirely satisfied with your purchase, we offer a hassle-free return policy to make your shopping experience as seamless as possible. Please review the following guidelines for our return policy:
                        </p>
                        <p>Eligibility:</p>
                        <p>
                            Only products purchased directly from the SpareTrade website are eligible for return.
                            Products must be unused, undamaged, and in their original packaging.
                            Return requests must be initiated within [2] days from the date of delivery.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pack the product securely in its original packaging, including all accessories, manuals, and any promotional items that were included with the purchase.
                            Clearly label the package with the return authorization provided by our customer support team.

                        <p>Return Shipping:</p>
                        <p>
                            Customers are responsible for the return shipping costs unless the return is due to an error on our part (e.g., wrong item shipped, damaged product).
                            We recommend using a reliable shipping method with tracking and insurance for the return shipment. SpareTrade is not responsible for any lost or damaged return packages.
                        </p>
                        <p>Inspection and Refund:</p>
                        <p>
                            Once we receive the returned product, our team will inspect it to ensure it meets our return policy requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the returned product meets the eligibility criteria, we will issue a refund for the purchase price, excluding any shipping charges, to the original payment method used for the purchase.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please allow 7 business days for the refund to be processed. The timing of the refund may vary depending on the payment method and financial institution.
